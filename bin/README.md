# E-Commerce Backend (Spring Boot)

This project is a simple e-commerce backend that I am building to understand how real backend systems work. The main goal is to learn how to handle common features like user login, product listing, cart management, and order processing using Java and Spring Boot.

##  What I am learning through this project

- How to structure a Spring Boot application using Controller, Service, and Repository layers  
- Applying basic and advanced Java concepts (OOP, interfaces, collections, streams, exceptions)  
- Building REST APIs and handling request/response flows  
- Using Spring Security and JWT for login and authentication  
- Working with MySQL and understanding how JPA/Hibernate handle entity relationships  
- Creating relationships like One-to-Many, Many-to-One, etc.  

## 📦 Main Features

- User registration and login with JWT  
- OTP-based email verification  
- Product management (add, update, list, delete)  
- Add to cart, update cart items, remove items  
- Basic role management (user/seller/admin)  

##  Technologies

- Java  
- Spring Boot  
- Spring Security  
- Spring Data JPA / Hibernate  
- MySQL  
- Maven  

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository  
2. Update database configuration in `application.properties`  
3. Run using your IDE or:

## Current Status

This project is still in development.  
I am adding new features as I keep learning more about backend development with Java and Spring Boot.
